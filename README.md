# Pharmacy Products App

### This React application was developed as part of the interview process for a Frontend Developer position. While it serves as a demonstration of your skills, it is important to note that the app is not yet production-ready. Several areas, including error handling, form validation, and overall code cleanliness, require further attention and refinement.

## Features
### CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on pharmacy products.
### Data Visualization: Utilize Recharts to render charts displaying additional insights into the product data.
### Persistence: Products are stored in browser memory using localStorage.

## Tech Stack
### Built with Vite, Yarn, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ShadCN.UI, ESLint, Prettier, and Recharts.

# Getting Started

## Node Version:
### Ensure you have Node.js installed. Recommended version: >=20.00.0.
```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```
## Sample Data
### The app includes sample data for demonstration purposes. It can be found in ./config with other constants and mock data and includes product information such as name, manufacturer, price, and expiry date.

## Known Issues and Future Work
### The application is a work in progress and is not yet polished for production use.
### Areas needing improvement include error handling, form validation, and overall code refactoring.
### Consideration should be given to implementing testing procedures.
### Search the codebase for comments staring with "TODO:" prefix, as those are the places recognized with bugs or at risk.
